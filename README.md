Signals

In this Assignment we had to implement timers whenever a signal is received. The task was interesting, and especially when developing the progress bar (ex2.c). However, when trying to implement a code to create parallel processes using fork(), was a bit challenging since it is a difficult topic.
The whole development of the Assignment can be ovserved in the "Assignment_5" PDF file.
